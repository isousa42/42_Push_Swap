> *"The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted"*
</br>
</br>
<p> The aim of this project is to select and manipulate different algorithms so it will be possible to sort a stack using limited number of movements. </br></p>
<p> It will be passed to the program, by argument, the integers that will be sorted. This integers are going to be inserted in a Stack. </br></p>
<p> To sort it, the student may only use an auxiliary stack and some of given functions that will make a determinated movement. </br></p>
<p> Using this movements, the program as to sort the stack in the minimum number of movements possible.</br></p>
</br>
<p> PUSH_SWAP (MANDATORY) OK (3/4) ✔️ PUSH_SWAP (BONUS) OK ✔️</p>
<p> Moulinette Grade: 110% </p>
